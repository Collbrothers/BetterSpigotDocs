# BetterSpigotDocs

**"A modern and open source version of Spigot's documentation"**

### What is the difference between the official Spigot documentation and BetterSpigotDocs?
> While the official documentation is robust and fully completed BetterSpigotDocs focuses more on quality and improving the user experience. 
> We strive to make your life as a developer as easy as possible with easy to read examples and descriptions
### I can't find a certain class in the documentation?
> Since BetterSpigotDocs does not use JavaDoc (to improve simplicity) we rely on contributors to add new additions. 
> If you can't find what you are looking for you might want to add it (see [here](docs/guide/contributing.md))!
