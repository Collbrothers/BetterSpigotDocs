# Installation
Installing Spigot is not necessarily too hard
### Requirements
0 - 10 players:
| Entity      | Minimum | Recommended |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU/Threads | 1       | 2+          |
| CPU/Cores   | 1       | 3+          |
| CPU/Speed   | 2GHz    | 3GHz+       |
| RAM         | 512Mb   | 3Gb         |
| ETHERNET    | 3Mb 2Mb | 8Mb 4Mb     |

When going above 10 players the only upgrades you need are: RAM, Ethernet stability & speed and CPU clock speed

Notes:
- Ethernet is not required, but highly recommended
- Ethernet format: Up Down
- Since Spigot does not support multithreading you only really need one, but two others can be useful for sockets etc
- If you want peak performance; look into [paper](https://papermc.io/) due to paper support multicore usage, but it might not be as stable as spigot
- It's always recommended to make backups of your server once in a while; always make sure you have a little of extra space on your HDD/SSD

### Do's & Don'ts
:white_check_mark: Do this:
- Try to use a lightweight OS for the server; [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview) (We will go deeper into servers [here](https://betterspigotdocs.org/guide/operating-system))

:x: Do <span style="color: #ff0033">**NOT**</span> do this:
- Run GUI mode when you are NOT debugging
